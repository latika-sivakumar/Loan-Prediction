KEY FEATURES: ~ Data Visualization: Generates various insightful plots like loan status distribution, income vs. loan amount scatterplots, and category-wise comparisons to understand patterns and correlations in the dataset. ~ Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding, ensuring the data is clean and model-ready. ~ Feature Scaling: Applies Standardization to numeric features using StandardScaler to improve model performance and training stability. ~ Model Building: Implements a Logistic Regression model with an increased iteration limit for better convergence on real-world financial data. ~ Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance using accuracy score, providing a clear metric to judge model effectiveness on unseen data. ~ Automated Handling of Inconsistent Columns: Aligns training and testing datasets after encoding, automatically filling missing columns with zeros for smooth model prediction. ~ Modular Workflow: Organized flow from data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, to evaluation, making it easy to understand and modify for future improvements.

USE CASES: ~ Loan Approval Prediction: Banks and financial institutions can use this model to predict the probability of a loan applicant getting their loan approved based on their income, education, property area, and other factors. ~ Credit Risk Assessment: Helps financial analysts quickly identify high-risk applications, aiding faster and data-driven decision-making. ~ Educational Tool: A practical example for students and beginners to learn end-to-end machine learning workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation. ~ Business Strategy Planning: Useful for companies to strategize marketing and loan offerings by understanding customer behavior patterns through visualizations and predictions. ~ Model Enhancement Base: Can be used as a starting point for building more complex models using ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to further improve accuracy.
